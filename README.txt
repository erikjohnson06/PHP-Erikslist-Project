erikslist
=========

Erikslist is a site that is essentially a clone of Craigslist.com. This project was completed as a part of the O'Reilly PHP/SQL 3 course to demonstrate the Web 2.0 concepts of scalable design, user-generated content, folksonomy, etc. I had a lot of fun creating this site from scratch. Several pages are created as "single-page applications". Each php file contains information about its primary functionality at the top.
